##  Overview

The samothrakiupscaler project is an open-source Python script that performs image upscaling using the Samothraki method. This method involves applying a series of transformations to an input image to increase its resolution. The script uses the StableDiffusionControlNetImg2ImgPipeline class from the diffusers library to perform the upscaling process. 

The project's key features include:
Image upscaling using the Samothraki method
Convenient way to perform image upscaling in Python
Easy modification or extension for specific use cases or requirements

The target audience for this project includes software engineers, data scientists, and researchers who are interested in image processing and upscaling techniques. The project's open-source nature also makes it accessible to a wider range of users and contributors.

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Package Manager:** Pip


###  Installation

Install samothraki_upscaler using one of the following methods:

**Build from source:**

1. Clone the samothraki_upscaler repository:
```sh
❯ git clone https://github.com/mamorett/samothraki_upscaler
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
❯ cd samothraki_upscaler
```

3. Install the project dependencies:


**Using `pip`** &nbsp; [<img align="center" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Pip-3776AB.svg?style={badge_style}&logo=pypi&logoColor=white" />](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

```sh
❯ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Prerequisites

Create a `.env` file containing the following variables:

```bash
CONTROLNET_MODEL_PATH_1="<your_dir>/models/controlnet/control_v11f1e_sd15_tile.safetensors"
CONTROLNET_MODEL_PATH_2="<your_dir>/models/controlnet/control_v11p_sd15_inpaint_fp16.safetensors"
SD_MODEL_PATH="/gorgon/ia/modelli/checkpoints/sd15/juggernaut_reborn.safetensors"
VAE_MODEL_PATH="<your_dir>/models/vae/vae-ft-mse-840000-ema-pruned.ckpt"
LORA_WEIGHTS_PATH_1="<your_dir>/models/loras/LCM_LoRA_Weights_SD15.safetensors" 
LORA_WEIGHTS_PATH_2="<your_dir>/models/loras/more_details.safetensors"
UPSCALE_MODEL="<your_dir>/models/upscale_models/4x_NMKD-Siax_200k.pth"
```


### Basic Usage
To use the Samothraki Upscaler, you can run:

```bash
python -m samothraki.upscaler [input] [-o output]
```

Where:
- `input` is either a single image file or a directory of input images.
- `-o output` specifies the output directory (optional).

### Required Parameters

#### Input Parameters
You must provide exactly one of the following:

1. **Single Image**
```bash
samothraki.upscaler -i input_image.jpg
```

2. **Directory of Images**
```bash
samothraki.upscaler -d input_directory/
```

### Optional Parameters

- `--scale_by`: Scale factor for upsampling (defaults to 2.0). Use values like `4.0` for higher magnifications.
  
  ```bash
  samothraki.upscaler -i input.jpg --scale_by 4.0
  ```

- `--num_inference_steps`: Number of sampling steps for image generation (defaults to 20).

  ```bash
  samothraki.upscaler -d input_dir --num_inference_steps 30
  ```

- `--strength`: Strength parameter for upscaling effects (defaults to 1.0).

  samothraki.upscaler -i image.jpg --strength 0.8
  ```

  - `--calculate-tiles`: Calculate tile size. If not set tile size is set to 1024 (defaults to False).

  ```bash
  samothraki.upscaler -i image.jpg --calculate-tiles
  ```

### Output 

- Single image mode: Creates an upscaled version with "upscaled_" prefix
- Directory mode: Creates an "UPSCALED" subdirectory containing all processed images
